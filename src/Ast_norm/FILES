Cost           : types used to describe normalization costs

Package_env    : environment that records "with packages" and "use packages".
                 given an id, finds which package(s) define it.
		 == keeps track of known packages and of USEs

Loc_env        : decl_env == environment mapping identifiers to their declaration (local var, for, argument, decl in package)
                 because we must not qualify a local identifier
		 == keeps track of all identifiers defined locally

Nmspace        : Keep track of the current namespace, using loc_env & package_env.
                 Offers an extensible tree_mapper.

Nm_qualify     : Qualifies all possible identifiers (prefix them with their package), using nmspace.

Depend         : find dependencies between expressions, so that they can be reordered.

Astnorm        : normalizing functions
                    - flatten sequences
		    - expand var inits
		    - other normalisation (see Cost)

Normfile       : Call in sequence the appropriate normalizing functions.
